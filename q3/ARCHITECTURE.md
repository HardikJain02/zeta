# Banking API Architecture

This document outlines the architecture and design decisions for the Zeta Banking API, which is designed to process millions of banking transactions daily while ensuring high consistency, low latency, and resilience to failures.

## Architecture Overview

The API follows a layered architecture pattern:

1. **API Layer**: FastAPI-based RESTful endpoints
2. **Service Layer**: Business logic and transaction handling
3. **Data Access Layer**: Database models and operations
4. **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL with proper indexes and constraints

## Database Schema

We use a relational database (PostgreSQL) with two primary tables:

1. **Accounts Table**:
   - Stores account details and current balance
   - Uses version column for optimistic locking
   - Has constraints to prevent negative balances
   - Indexed on account_number for fast lookups

2. **Transactions Table**:
   - Records all financial operations (credit/debit)
   - Maintains transaction status (pending, completed, failed, reversed)
   - Linked to accounts via foreign key with cascade delete
   - Indexed for efficient querying by account_id, status, and creation date

## Concurrency Control

We use a combination of strategies to handle concurrent requests:

1. **Database Transactions**: Every operation is wrapped in a database transaction to ensure atomicity
2. **Row-Level Locking**: We lock the account row during balance updates to prevent race conditions
3. **Optimistic Locking**: The version field in the account table prevents lost updates
4. **Isolation Level**: We use REPEATABLE READ isolation level to prevent phantom reads
5. **Connection Pooling**: Efficiently manages database connections for high throughput

## Consistency Guarantees

1. **Atomicity**: Transactions are fully completed or fully rolled back
2. **Crash Recovery**: Database transactions ensure that in case of a crash, the system will recover to a consistent state
3. **Validation**: Input validation prevents invalid data from entering the system
4. **Database Constraints**: CHECK constraints at the database level prevent negative balances

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse database connections to reduce overhead
2. **Indexes**: Strategic indexes on frequently queried columns
3. **Database Tuning**: Proper PostgreSQL configuration for transaction processing
4. **Async Processing**: Non-critical operations can be processed asynchronously
5. **Caching**: (Future enhancement) Cache frequently accessed account information

## Scalability Considerations

1. **Horizontal Scaling**: The API can be scaled horizontally by adding more instances
2. **Vertical Scaling**: Database resources can be increased for higher throughput
3. **Sharding**: (Future enhancement) Accounts could be sharded by account number or region
4. **Read Replicas**: (Future enhancement) Use read replicas for balance inquiries and reporting

## Error Handling

1. **Clear Error Messages**: Descriptive error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
2. **Retry Mechanism**: Automatic retry for transient database errors
3. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and audit purposes
4. **Transaction Status**: Each transaction has a status that reflects its current state

## Resilience Features

1. **Retry Mechanism**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient failures
2. **Circuit Breaker**: (Future enhancement) Prevent cascading failures during database issues
3. **Health Checks**: Monitor system health and dependencies
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse and ensure fair usage

## Security Considerations

1. **Input Validation**: Strict validation of all input data
2. **Parameterized Queries**: Protection against SQL injection
3. **Logging**: Audit logs for all financial transactions
4. **Future Enhancements**: Authentication, authorization, and encryption

## Monitoring and Observability

1. **Request Tracing**: Each request has a unique ID for tracing
2. **Performance Metrics**: Response time tracking
3. **Health Endpoints**: Monitor system health
4. **Logging**: Structured logs for analysis

## Deployment Strategy

1. **Containerization**: Docker for consistent deployments
2. **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for scaling and management
3. **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment
4. **Blue/Green Deployment**: Minimize downtime during updates
